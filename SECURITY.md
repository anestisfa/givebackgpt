# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We encourage everyone using or contributing to our project to promptly report any potential security issues. Here's how you can help:

- **Notify us privately**: Send an email to [info@medoid.ai](mailto:info@medoid.ai) and clearly state that it's about security. For example, use a subject line like "Safety Problem - Project Name".
  
- **Provide details**: Describe the issue with as much detail as possible. If you have evidence such as code snippets or logs, include them in your email.

- **Responsible disclosure**: Please allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before discussing it publicly. This ensures we can fix it before it becomes a larger problem.

Thank you for your help in keeping our project secure!
